# First, building the static files
FROM node:10.16.2-alpine as build

WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./

# Production or not doesn't really matter as this image will not be used other than for building
RUN npm install

COPY src/ ./

# Building the image
RUN npm run build

# Then, use nginx to serve the built files
# See https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copying the built files into the nginx image, to the default served directory
COPY --from=build /usr/src/app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
# If a custom nginx.conf is necessary (for routing some stuff, sometimes React Router has trouble with nginx it seems - should use @reach anyway tbh)
# COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

# No need to expose anything or specify any CMD, as the nginx image already does that, and it is best to not mess with it
