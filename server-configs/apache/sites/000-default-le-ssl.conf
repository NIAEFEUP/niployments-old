# Probably leaving this as legacy, but note that this is (or should be) dead code, as certificates are now gotten from uporto's CA stuff (digicert) and not Let's Encrypt!
# Also, please use includes now, otherwise we'll have a loooot of repetition (tried to refactor all that into /etc/apache2/conf/ :) - Miguel, 2019/08/06

	# The ServerName directive sets the request scheme, hostname and port that
	# the server uses to identify itself. This is used when creating
	# redirection URLs. In the context of virtual hosts, the ServerName
	# specifies what hostname must appear in the request's Host: header to
	# match this virtual host. For the default virtual host (this file) this
	# value is not decisive as it is used as a last resort host regardless.
	# However, you must set it for any further virtual host explicitly.
