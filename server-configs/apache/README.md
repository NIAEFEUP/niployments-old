# Apache configs for Ni's server

WIP, just pushing to send this somewhere, for now

TODO:

- rename sites (000 whatevers)
- figure out a mechanism to distinguish a site from simply available or also enabled
- add a script for updating the apache configs (and possible reloading the service - maybe dangerous?) -> will symlink stuff around and etc
- think about the best arch in terms of where the files should be and where they should be referenced -> when to use env vars too

Currently enabled sites:

- 000-default.conf
- 000-default-ssl.conf
